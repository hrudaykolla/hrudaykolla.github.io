    st.write("Description: Simple architecture for segmenting convex objects in images using user-provided scribbles. The proposed approach involves a primary model to segment pixels into foreground and background regions. The primary modelâ€™s output is subsequently passed to a Convex network, which refines the foreground pixels to adhere to the convexity prior, assuming smooth and continuous boundaries without concave regions. The architecture achieves memory efficiency and does not require training on a vast number of images, making it suitable for practical applications with limited computational resources.")
